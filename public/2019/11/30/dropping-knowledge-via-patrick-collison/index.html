    <h1>Dropping Knowledge via Patrick Collison</h1>
    <p>Posted at 2019-11-30 11:47:00+02:00</p>
    <p>An entrepreneur hero of mine, Patrick Collison - founder of <a href="stripe.com">Stripe</a>, has a wealth of knowledge and readily shares it on his personal website. His trove includes his bookshelf (an idea I took for my website), research on pollution, his own list of people he regards to be change-makers and even a collection of things that were completed very quickly like the Eifel Tower being built in two years. </p>
