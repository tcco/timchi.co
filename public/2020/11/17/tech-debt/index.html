    <h1>Technical Chops to put to the Test</h1>
    <p>Posted at 2020-11-17 11:47:00+02:00</p>
    <h1>Always go back to first principles</h1>
<p>After six months of product innovation within Uplift, I got placed onto an internal engineering team for "technical leadership". Enter Servicing Engineering. Prior to joining, I heard about fires left and right, mistakes being made, and was already fielding inquisitions from a variety of personnel before I knew anything about anything! Seemingly interesting times ahead - the atypical growing pains of any growth startup.</p>
<p>The task became figuring out what is what and why the engineering was the way it was. Remember a close friend asking, who is on boarding me, which was met with a pause. When I joined, the team was allocating 5-6 engineers on "Run the Business" type activity. Fixing issues rather than actual engineering. Luckily, I linked arms with a founding architect and a young savant engineer also bent on solving these long lived issues, whom decided to tackle this problem together with me. Building from the foundation up, conceptualizing the idea of business and engineering primitives this group needed to rightfully define. From there, we made clear where business requirements lived and how those were translated into engineering principles, essentially who owned what.</p>
<p>We were off. Began our first rebuild and of course, covid-19 hit. Essentially our quest to re-think this system stopped momentarily. Having to adjust and pump out relief programs for Uplift borrowers. Honestly, a blessing in disguise. This allowed us to stream line our foundational components, integrating technologies like GraphQL and internally owned tools that allowed for robust and scalable systems. Fully integrating, understanding, and controlling these tools, a quintessential for technical folk but unbeknown to most. Building an ecosystem surrounding the business processes that'd have be to rebuilt, eventually.</p>
<p>Six months in, after the discovery phase and relief programs, we drew a line in the sand. We deemed our foundation ready and believed we had a gap to rebuild. The one process we paused to rebuild was slated but we decided to pursue three this time, a true test of the foundation. None truer, sound architecture, utmost focus, and grit to see things through to the end is how this type of activity gets done. Sifting through the what, how, and even questioning the why was endless. Foraging in newly develop paradigms and appropriating it for 4 year old systems that had been compiled over time. Our results were 10x, rebuilt three systems in parallel in two-three months with full parity to legacy systems, and primed for follow-on capabilities. The process was about simplification, delineation, and of course organization.</p>
