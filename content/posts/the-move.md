Kim and I have moved into our first property together! Real estate has always been a passion and I'm happy to of gone through a buying journey with Kim. We went to one day of open houses (a couple other of private showings) and somehow came across a gem. We found our "house hack" that allows us to alleviates some of the burdens of monthly costs. Lots of negotiating prices, vendors, furniture and many other items but we made it work and are now moved in! Excited for things to come.
