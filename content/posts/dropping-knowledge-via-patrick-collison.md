An entrepreneur hero of mine, Patrick Collison - founder of [Stripe](stripe.com), has a wealth of knowledge and readily shares it on his personal website. His trove includes his bookshelf (an idea I took for my website), research on pollution, his own list of people he regards to be change-makers and even a collection of things that were completed very quickly like the Eifel Tower being built in two years.

Awesome stuff. Take a look, I know I'll be dissecting this!
