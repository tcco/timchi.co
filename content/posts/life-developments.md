2022 began with a new initiative for me at Uplift. My sole objectives were to build a DTC mobile app and launch a new vertical in a growth crew. This opportunity felt closer to home, much more similar to what I've previously shipped before - building from the ground up, capturing new opportunity as opposed to the [tech debt challenge](../../../../2020/11/17/tech-debt) prior.

## Start
Forming was interesting. There are limited resources in an organization, everyone is typically tied up in the roadmaps they've already committed to for years (if not a quarter) to come. I myself wasn't any exception, which made the journey to start all the more interesting.

The executive team ended up carving out a couple execs, marketing, myself and then hired two new product growth managers that would come to be my closest colleagues for the year to come. An Asana roadmap was our starting spot and north star. We had to assemble developers, tooling, develop processes and get building. This lead time is no joke and ate up a month or two. Luckily we had the luxury of this project being top of mind and quickly landing a development agency out of Uruguay that was best in class, not having sunk cost on developers is a huge win.

## Interuptions
Essentially building as fast and heads down as possible, we launched two thirds of our app in two months. This would be the shopping, adding to shopping lists, and pre-approval and purchasing experience. Also included were ancillary user flows like registration, settings and as well integrated tooling for analytics, user feedback etc.

Like any other build, there wasn't a chance this would go this smoothly. The remaining tab in our initial build was the borrower portal. One that would tie us back into existing infrastructure and create reliance on others - our internal team. It's not that there are inefficiencies inherently it's once again just the problem of them focusing on their own priorities.

I myself as the sole engineering lead at the time, had my own distractions seeing as my wedding and extended honeymoon were planned for April/May (Life Developments). Naively believing the forward progress would be maintained, I took my leave of absence, only to come back to blockers on top of blockers. Features riddled with contextual know how and order of operations in terms of builds. Not only that but features that were being released internally now affected our builds, which took it's own degree of navigation.
